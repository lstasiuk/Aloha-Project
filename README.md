# Aloha Project

This is the details of the Aloha Project.

I found this project extremely challenging, however, learned a lot and will continue to grow from this.

Major learning from this project:
- how to clearly write HTML
- how to properly reference my CSS to my HTML
- the use of color, background images and gradients
- flexbox
- how to target the parent and children properly (at least in theory)
- git push and git hub and using the terminal
- how to properly style fonts
- the use of lists
- padding and margins
- @media-links
- basic Javascript and jQuery

I also felt it was important for me to go back to the beginning of the HTML and CSS courses to start from the beginning so more could make sense to me.  I still feel very behind on concepts but am hoping things will become clearer.
