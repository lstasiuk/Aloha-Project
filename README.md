# Aloha Project

This is the details of the Aloha Project.

I found this project extremely challenging, however, learned a lot and will continue to grow from this.

Major learning from this project:
- how to clearly write HTML
- how to properly reference my CSS to my HTML
- the use of color, background images and gradients
- flexbox
- how to target the parent and children properly (at least in theory)
- git push and git hub and using the terminal
- how to properly style fonts
- the use of lists
- padding and margins
- @media-links
- basic Javascript and jQuery
